index_p1="<a href='https://openbsd.org'>OpenBSD</a> is universally known as an operating
system designed with security in mind, proudly being able to say that it has had
&ldquo;Only two remote holes in the default install, in a heck of a long time!&rdquo;"

index_p2="However, OpenBSD ships with
<a href='https://cvsweb.openbsd.org/cgi-bin/cvsweb/src/sys/dev/microcode'>several pieces of
non-free, binary only firmware</a> in the base system, and depending on the hardware
detected, by default
<a href='https://cvsweb.openbsd.org/cgi-bin/cvsweb/src/distrib/miniroot/install.sub.diff?r1=1.653&r2=1.654&f=h'>
a script will download more at first boot</a>, without informing the user."

index_p3="While there may be some good reasons for including this firmware, with a
default installation you might end up running some of these non-free blobs without even
knowing it."

index_p4="LibertyBSD is a 'deblobbed' version of OpenBSD. The non-free blobs in OpenBSD
have been purged from LibertyBSD, so you can enjoy the benefits of OpenBSD without
sacrificing your freedom."

# FAQ
# --------------------------------------
title_faq="LBSD - FAQs"
faq_faq="Frequently Asked Questions"

faq_qarch="What architectures does LBSD support?"
faq_aarch="Since 5.9, both <code>amd64</code> and <code>i386</code> are
supported."
faq_qfsf="Is LibertyBSD FSF-approved?"
faq_afsf="We're going through the process to be approved as FSDG-compliant."
faq_qerrata="So, what about security updatesâ€¦?"
faq_aerrata="You can find patches <a href='errata.shtml'>here</a>.
You can manually compile and apply the patches yourself, if you want.</br>
Or you could use <code>syspatch</code>. Whatever floats your boat."
faq_qman="Where are the man-pages?"
faq_aman="In 5.6, man-pages were excluded-- but since then, they've been
included by default. We've added on to them, even!
<code>free-software(7)</code> and <code>fsdg(7)</code>, specifically."
faq_qcontact="Where can I contact you, or get some help?"
faq_acontact="You can write to
<a href='https://raddle.me/f/libertybsd'>/f/libertybsd</a> at raddle.me
(you're certain to get a response there), the #libertybsd IRC channel at
irc.freenode.net (almost certain to get a response, if a tad delayed), or
<a href='https://reddit.com/r/libertybsd'>/r/libertybsd</a> at reddit.com
(unlikely to get a response there).<br>
If it's a more private matter, you can e-mail Jaidyn <jadedctrl AT teknik.io>."
faq_qsources="Cool, whatever. Where's the sauce, mate?"
faq_asources="You can find the patched source-code in your local FTP/HTTP
mirror under 'src.tar.gz', 'sys.tar.gz', and 'xenocara.tar.gz'. If you want
the scripts used to patch it, you'll find those over at
<a href='https://git.eunichx.us/libertybsd-scripts'>the git repo</a>."
faq_qnonfree="Aha! I've found something non-free in LibertyBSD!"
faq_anonfree="Impressive eyes you've got there!
<a href='faq.shtml#contact'>Contact us</a> right away, please!
(According to me, you deserve a GNU buck. ;))"
faq_qproblems="I have a problem with LBSD. Can I use the OpenBSD mailing list?"
faq_aproblems="You really shouldn't! LibertyBSD might be a simple downstream,
but it <i>does</i> have modifications-- so you shouldn't report bugs unless
replicated in OpenBSD, or ask for help. Don't bother them, please! Instead,
bother us. We'll help you the best we can. ;)"
faq_qports="Where's the ports tree? Package repo?"
faq_aports="They're in your mirror's directory for your version-- under
'packages' for the repo, and 'ports.tar.gz' for the ports tree. (The ports
tree and repo are pure and squeaky-clean, by the way~)"
